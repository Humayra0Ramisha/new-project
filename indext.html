    <h3 class="paragragh-heading">Journey By Bus</h3>
    <p>My friend Aman wanted to visit Agra to see the Taj Mahal. I was agreed with him but we had no car. Then we decided to go there by bus. I always prefer the bus for a long journey. Then we fixed a date and bought an advance ticket for this date. We were so much excited about the journey and about seeing the Taj.Finally, the day came and we went to the bus counter at 8 o’clock morning. Our bus departed from the counter at 8.30 o’clock. Within 20 minutes, we went out of the city and the local living area. We started to see the beautiful jungle outside. That was an amazing experience for me. I sat on the window seat.We were gossiping about several things. And Aman was reading a storybook. Then after two hours, he sat on the window seat and I sat on his seat. We went to Agra after five hours of the journey. The journey was so much enjoyable and pleasant. I will never forget that journey by bus.  </p>

    <h3 class="paragragh-heading">Journey By Train</h3>
    <p>A train journey is the most precious thing for me. It is even more exciting when I am travelling with my friends and family. I remember when I was travelling to Mumbai with my whole family for my cousin’s marriage. It was a great experience for me because it was the second time when I was travelling out of my hometown. It was beautiful to watch people crossing the train, which looked like a train and bike competition, and some kids waved their hands to say goodbye. Compared to a flight journey, sitting on the window seat and enjoying nature is so precious. It is even more beautiful to watch the sunset between the hills while enjoying the evening tea. Every time a tea vendor crossed, my mother would call him and buy us some snacks. Even if you are on a diet, it becomes hard for you to restrict yourself to rush to the food stall in every station. If you are bored, you can read a newspaper or a magazine, a story book, etc.</p>

    <p>A journey by boat is an experience that combines excitement, adventure, and relaxation. Whether it is a short trip on a small boat or a long voyage on a cruise ship, the experience of traveling on water is unique and unforgettable. The serene beauty of nature that surrounds you, the sound of the waves, and the cool breeze are just some of the things that make a journey by boat so special. When traveling by boat, you get to see different parts of the world from a different perspective, providing a new and exciting way to explore new places and cultures.
